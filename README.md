# yt-to-mp3
=============READ ME BEFORE USE============

Hello,
For any issue contact: api@youtube6download.top

This is PHP Object oriented programming based Yt to mp3 API Script. You can use it to fetch mp3 links of single/multiple youtube videos from your site.

It is a beta version of my script.
Just download the zip file.

// To convert single video
Open index.php file
Look at the first line
 // YOUTUBE VIDEO ID
 $id = 'lF-jPBnZ098';

// For converting multiple videos as mp3
open multiple.php
Look at the line start with:
// MULTIPLE YOUTUBE VIDEO ID's SEPARATED BY COMMNA (,)
  $ids = 'lF-jPBnZ098,OmAlu5T44t8,GTJHrHHAElU';
  
All you need to do is to change the $id variable value with the desired video id that you want to download as mp3.
That's it!
If you have php installed on your server/localhost then you we'll get result on the webpage.
